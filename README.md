### What it does:

This mod is more then just waypoints...
It offers a rating system, build in "Partyfinder" for carries and so much more!

### Why is this useful?
For those who are new to carries, they can get a full guide with waypoints.
Also searching carries is easier, then ever before, just do /Carryfinder and enjoy a custom searching system with offers, requests and a rating system!

### Is this bannable?
Short answer: This mod follows the general interpretation of Hypixel's rules, does not modify packets in any way, and is most likely **not bannable**, but as with all mods, it is use at your own risk.
